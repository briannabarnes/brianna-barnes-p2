                I’m Bri. I am a creator. I create all kinds of things. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I have many trades – drawing, writing, coding, designing, crocheting – just to name a few.
                <br>
                <br>
                I started my path through technology about 6 years ago and I’ve taught myself everything that I know. I won’t super bore
                you with the details, if you care to learn more you can find my LinkedIn profile at the bottom of this page. But I’ve
                learned so much in these four years, and after spending the last months building a website for a local boutique in my
                hometown, I’ve found the most happiness in building, designing, and troubleshooting. I also enjoy finding new ways to
                solve new problems, as well as finding new and fun ways to automate things in life.
                <br>
                <br>
                I also have a tiny, baby boutique of my own – selling the many things I love to make. Mostly crochet work. But sometimes
                you’ll see over various items in the mix, too.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am an Arizona native, lived there most of my life. Until May of 2020 – my boyfriend and I moved to Milwaukee, WI.
                Which is where I am now. We have two beautiful dogs and enjoy good food, beers and movies. Just like everyone else, we
                are learning to navigate this new world living through a pandemic.
                <br>
                <br>
                Feel free to look around, I try my best to update often. Although, it’s not uncommon for me to put my time into my
                clients work often than my own.
